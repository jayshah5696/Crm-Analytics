# CRM ANALYTICS: CUSTOMER CHURN, APPETENCY AND UPSELLING PREDICTION FOR A MOBILE NETWORK OPERATOR


With the evolution CRM adoption has become essential for every service/goods providing
firms. In order to yield maximum profits, to serve the needs of their customer in a better way,
and to provide the customers every time with the compelling deals data analytics complements
CRM in a unique way. The efficient market hypothesis suggests that practically it is impossible
to predict the customer’s behaviors in B2B or B2C firms. But also, there are number of firms
who are doing this very efficiently through the myriad information of past customers’ data and
through the sophisticated use of data analytics.


Since people cannot predict what will happen next, forecasting what will occur mostly has been
one challenging and concerned issues in many areas especially in CRM prediction. But,
whenever the predictions with less bias is produced it will enable the firms to make good
amount of profits. As the emergence of new advanced predicting techniques such as artificial
neural networks (ANN), time series, fuzzy time series models and etc. that has enabled the
firms to make excellent predictions with minimal supervision and assumptions. The main
constraints in conventional techniques are number of assumptions are required to be made by
analyst, dependent and independent variables and a threshold value to make predictions isn’t
easy to be found. For the reasons above, and in order to overcome above constraints in this
report we have analysed the power of Artificial neural networks and Multilevel classification
techniques and has benchmarked them to evaluate the performance of conventional
classification techniques such as logistic regression, KNN, random forest, boosting, bagging,
to name a few.


## Objective
As has been mentioned earlier, objective of this project is to try and predict one of the most influential terms for any firm to grow exponentially- customers’ churn, appetency and upselling tendency. Basically in this three class classification problem, we have set our objectives to build a model which should be sensitive enough to the new upcoming data and also it should predict/mimic a result as close as possible. And to achieve this we have used both known and unknown techniques.
## Importance of the Customer relationship management

C-R-M stands for Customer Relationship Management. At its simple definition CRM allows firms to manage business relationships and data related to them. CRM is a key element of modern marketing strategies. Any business basically start with a foundation of a great patron relationship. And with the firm’s growth this relationship management becomes more sophisticated. You need to share myriad of information across various teams within your organization. This is where the CRM can serve as a vital nerve center to manage the many connections that happen in a growing business. CRM gives everyone across the business, sales, marketing, a better way to manage the customer relationships and interactions that drive success.


The most practical way to build knowledge about customers is to predict the score as per number of variables and through these scores, customers’ tendency to churn, appetency or upselling is determined. And accordingly the scores produced by system is used to build/personalise the relationship with customers. Here, the main concern is to have rapid and robust detection of the important predictors which are essential for defining above mentioned relationships. And key implementation is to have the complete automation of the whole process. A system exploits the set of large hundreds predictors and thousands of instances and comes up with the best subset of predictors and instances which will best define the customer tendency. The KDD cup 2009 challenge was to beat the in-house classifier developed by the Orange- mobile network service providing company.

With mainly focussed towards and in a view to get the better insights into a CRM system, the problem mainly revolves around predicting the three prime terms, which are described as follows:
1. Churn rate
2. Appetency
3. Upselling


### 1. Churn

It is defined as the ratio of the subscribers who discontinue their service with the provider to the total number of subscribers. In a nutshell, churn is the customer turnover. Churn basically occurs when the supplier of service or goods doesn’t fulfil the customer’s perceived expectations. When any firm’s new customer enrolment rate is lesser than churn rate, then it can be said to make less sales and ultimately less profits in the future. And customer churn can be labeled as one of the most prime component of CRM.
### 2. Appetency: 
As the word explains, customer’s inclination to buy a service or good from the provider is called an appetency.

### 3. Upselling
Selling the customer a more expensive version of the product is the key to profitability for seller and are an advantage to the customer. Fundamentally, it is a win-win situation. Customer’s expectation is better met and your profit is increased. However, this is the only case when the policy is correct. And that is where the CRM comes into the play. One more advantage of a successful upselling is that it can improve customer relationship and cement customer relationship.


## Importance of this solution can be given as below:
- Needs of the customer is better identified by understanding their requirements.
-  Increased sales/profit through better prediction of the needs based on the historic trends. 
- Cross selling/Upselling of the products by highlighting and suggesting alternatives and enhancements. 
- Potential customer identification. 
-  This can lead to better marketing of products.

## Implemented Model
In this project due to so many missing values major task is going to be the data cleaning and data imputations. Apart from that we are going to apply following methods:
1. Random Forest
2. Bagging
3. Boosting
4. Support vector machine
5. Logistic regression
6. TREE
7. K-Nearest Neighbours
8. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
9. Multi label classification
